The Maverick's Museum: Albert Barnes and His American Dream,Blake Gopnik,"A fascinating biography of the philanthropist Albert Barnes, whose pioneering collection of modern art was meant to transform America’s soul

From prominent critic and biographer Blake Gopnik comes a compelling new portrait of America’s first great collector of modern art, Albert Coombs Barnes. Raised in a Philadelphia slum shortly after the Civil War, Barnes rose to earn a medical degree and then made a fortune from a pioneering antiseptic treatment for newborns. Never losing sight of the working-class neighbors of his youth, Barnes became a ruthless advocate for their rights and needs. His vast art collection—180 Renoirs, 67 Cézannes, 59 Matisses, 45 Picassos—was dedicated to enriching their cultural lives. A miner was more likely to get access than a mine owner.

Gopnik’s meticulous research reveals Barnes as a fierce advocate for the egalitarian ideals of his era’s progressive movement. But while his friends in the movement worked to reshape American society, Barnes wanted to transform the nation’s aesthetic life, taking art out of the hands of the elite and making it available to the average American.

The Maverick’s Museum offers a vivid picture of one of America’s great eccentrics. The sheer ferocity of Barnes’s democratic ambitions left him with more enemies than allies among people of all classes, but for a circle of intimates, he was a model of intelligence, generosity, and loyalty. In this compelling portrait, Gopnik reveals a life shaped by contradictions, one that left a lasting impact.",Hardcover,416 pages,"Expected publication March 18, 2025",Calificación no encontrada,No disponible,No disponible,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1731343701i/214504700.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/214504700-the-maverick-s-museum,Art
The Paris Girl,Francelle Bradford White,"Movingly written by her own daughter, this captivating and intimate biography chronicles the astonishing courage Andrée Griotteray, a teenage girl in Nazi-occupied Paris who would become a hero of the French Resistance through her harrowing work as an underground intelligence courier. For readers of Three Ordinary Girls, A Woman of No Importance, Lis Parisiennes, The Girls Who Stepped Out of Line, and the many other untold stories of WWII’s “hidden figures.”

Andrée Griotteray was just 19 when the Germans invaded France and occupied Paris, where she worked as a clerk in the passport office. When her younger brother, Alain, created a resistance network named Orion, Andrée joined his efforts, secretly typing up and printing copies of an underground newspaper, and stealing I.D. cards which allowed scores of Jewish citizens to escape persecution.

Charming and pretty, Andrée nimbly avoided the unwanted attentions of German officers, even as she secretly began working as an undercover courier. Displaying fearlessness in the face of immense pressure, she traveled throughout the county delivering vital intelligence destined for France’s allies—until the day she was betrayed and arrested.

Throughout her ordeal, Andrée stayed composed, refusing to inform on her comrades. Before she was set free, she even duped her interrogators into revealing who had betrayed Orion, and continued her underground activities until France’s liberation.

Weaving in diary entries, letters, and conversations, Andrée’s daughter, Francelle, brings a uniquely personal slant to her mother’s story. The Paris Girl reveals the narrow escapes and moments of terror, the daily acts of bravery and defiance, and the extraordinary courage displayed by Andrée and so many of her contemporaries, that helped turned the tide of war.",Hardcover,256 pages,"Expected publication December 24, 2024",Calificación no encontrada,No disponible,No disponible,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1711421028i/210365293.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/210365293-the-paris-girl,Biography

Merle Oberon attained Hollywood immortality with a nomination for a Best Leading Actress Oscar for her role in the 1936 film The Dark Angel. It was the first time a performer of color had received an acting nomination at the Academy Awards, but because Oberon concealed her South Asian identity throughout her lifetime and “passed” for white, very few people knew it. In Love, Queenie, the first biography in more than forty years of the India-born actress, Mayukh Sen draws on family interviews and previously untapped archival research to animate the star’s hard-won journey to fame. From an upbringing in poverty, she rose to the highest echelons of the film-world elite during Hollywood’s racially exclusionary Golden Age.

Belly Full: Exploring Caribbean Cuisine through 11 Fundamental Ingredients and Over 100 Recipes,Lesley Enston,"A delectable exploration of Caribbean cuisine through 105 recipes based on eleven staple ingredients, featuring powerful insights into the shared history of the diaspora and gorgeous photography.

“Lesley’s recipes inspire in the ways they approach, transcend, and unify cultural boundaries on page after delicious page.”—Hawa Hassan, author of In Bibi’s Kitchen

Across the English-speaking Caribbean, “me belly full” can mean more than just a satisfied stomach, but a heart and soul that’s full too. In Belly Full, food writer of Trinidadian descent Lesley Enston brings us into the overlapping histories of the Caribbean islands through their rich cultures and cuisines.

Eleven staple ingredients—beans, calabaza, cassava, chayote, coconut, cornmeal, okra, plantains, rice, salted cod, and scotch bonnet peppers—hold echoes of familiarity from one island to the next, and their widespread use comes in part from the harrowing impact of the Atlantic Slave Trade and colonialism. As Lesley delves into how history shaped each country and territory’s cuisine, she shows us what we can learn from each island (such as Haiti, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Trinidad & Tobago, and Cuba) and encourages us to celebrate the delicious differences.

Belly Full provides basic knowledge on choosing, storing, and preparing these ingredients as well as a mix of traditional and creative adaptations to dishes. Recipes are mostly gluten-free and plant-based and include:

• Cornmeal: Pen Mayi from Haiti and Conkies from Barbados
• Okra: Callaloo from Trinidad and Tobago and Fungee from Antigua
• Plantains: Mofongo from Puerto Rico and Tortilla de Plátano Maduro from Cuba
• Salted Cod: Ackee and Saltfish from Jamaica and Accras de Morue from Martinique

Family has never really worked out for Ben. When 11 year old Ben Turner’s new foster parents demand he get rid of his two dogs, the only real family he’s ever known, a magical balloon, the F.S Quest, appears one evening outside his window. It was the escape he had often dreamt of. To all of their delight, the balloon distributes magical enhancements to them. But instead of floating away happily ever after, they happen upon a young girl and her brother in desperate need of rescue.

Though Ben has entered a magical realm with an enchanted balloon at his command, has a wise magical guide, and magical troops on the ground, he also has sinister evil beings and an absolutely ruthless human family to deal with. Will the newly acquired magic be enough to help Ben and his friends free the young girl and her brother? Or--should they just sail away and leave well enough alone? And what about the powerful mysterious being who seems to be constantly tracking Ben?

It certainly wasn’t the journey Ben had been hoping for. But is it the one he truly needs?

Holy Men of the Electromagnetic Age: A Forgotten History of the Occult,Raphael Cormack,"An international history of the uncanny in the 1920s and 1930s.


The interwar period was a golden age for the occult. Spiritualists, clairvoyants, fakirs, Theosophists, mind readers, and Jinn summoners all set out to assure the masses that just as newly discovered invisible forces of electricity and magnetism determined the world of science, so unseen powers commanded an unknown realm of human potential.


Drawing on untapped sources in Arabic in addition to European ones, Raphael Cormack follows two of the most unusual and charismatic figures of this Tahra Bey, who took 1920s Paris by storm in the role of a missionary from the mystical East, and Dr Dahesh, who transformed Western science to create a panreligious faith of his own in Lebanon. Traveling between Paris, New York, and Beirut while claiming esoteric apprenticeships among miracle-working mystics in Egypt and Istanbul, these men reflected the desires and anxieties of a troubled age.

Black in Blues: How a Color Tells the Story of My People,Imani Perry,"A surprising and beautiful meditation on the color blue—and its fascinating role in Black history and culture—from National Book Award winner Imani Perry

Throughout history, the concept of Blackness has been remarkably intertwined with another color: blue. In daily life, it is evoked in countless ways. Blue skies and blue water offer hope for that which lies beyond the current conditions. But blue is also the color of deep melancholy and heartache, echoing Louis Armstrong’s question, “What did I do to be so Black and blue?” In this book, celebrated author Imani Perry uses the world’s favorite color as a springboard for a riveting emotional, cultural, and spiritual journey—an examination of race and Blackness that transcends politics or ideology.

Perry traces both blue and Blackness from their earliest roots to their many embodiments of contemporary culture, drawing deeply from her own life as well as art and history: The dyed indigo cloths of West Africa that were traded for human life in the 16th century. The mixture of awe and aversion in the old-fashioned characterization of dark-skinned people as “Blue Black.” The fundamentally American art form of blues music, sitting at the crossroads of pain and pleasure. The blue flowers Perry plants to honor a loved one gone too soon.

Poignant, spellbinding, and utterly original, Black in Blues is a brilliant new work that could only have come from the mind of one of our greatest writers and thinkers. Attuned to the harrowing and the sublime aspects of the human experience, it is every bit as vivid, rich, and striking as blue itself.",Hardcover,256 pages,"Expected publication January 28, 2025",Calificación no encontrada,No disponible,No disponible,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1726021576i/199534697.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199534697-black-in-blues,History

For readers of Three Ordinary Girls, A Woman of No Importance, Lis Parisiennes, The Girls Who Stepped Out of Line, and the many other untold stories of WWII’s “hidden figures.”

Andrée Griotteray was just 19 when the Germans invaded France and occupied Paris, where she worked as a clerk in the passport office. When her younger brother, Alain, created a resistance network named Orion, Andrée joined his efforts, secretly typing up and printing copies of an underground newspaper, and stealing I.D. cards which allowed scores of Jewish citizens to escape persecution.

Charming and pretty, Andrée nimbly avoided the unwanted attentions of German officers, even as she secretly began working as an undercover courier. Displaying fearlessness in the face of immense pressure, she traveled throughout the county delivering vital intelligence destined for France’s allies—until the day she was betrayed and arrested.

Throughout her ordeal, Andrée stayed composed, refusing to inform on her comrades. Before she was set free, she even duped her interrogators into revealing who had betrayed Orion, and continued her underground activities until France’s liberation.

Weaving in diary entries, letters, and conversations, Andrée’s daughter, Francelle, brings a uniquely personal slant to her mother’s story. The Paris Girl reveals the narrow escapes and moments of terror, the daily acts of bravery and defiance, and the extraordinary courage displayed by Andrée and so many of her contemporaries, that helped turned the tide of war.",Hardcover,256 pages,"Expected publication December 24, 2024",Calificación no encontrada,No disponible,No disponible,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1711421028i/210365293.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/210365293-the-paris-girl,History

The River's Daughter,Bridget Crocker,"Recalling memoirs like Wild and Educated, an internationally renowned female whitewater rafting guide offers a powerful, gripping, and inspiring memoir about overcoming hardship and coming into her own through her relationship with the rivers she has known.

After Bridget Crocker’s parents split up in a vicious divorce, she moved with her mother from California to Wyoming, to live in a trailer park near the Snake River. Her childhood was idyllic, with a stepfather she loved and a new baby brother, and with the river as her companion. When her mother suddenly left her stepfather for a hippie eco-warrior, and things went spectacularly wrong, Bridget returned to California to live with her explosive father—until his violence sent her back to Wyoming. The one constant in her life was the Snake River, to whom she confided her deepest feelings.

Being on the water healed Bridget—from abuse, sexual assault, and betrayals by those close to her. She became a world-class whitewater rafting guide—admired and respected by her mostly male counterparts for her grit and her courage. The Snake, the Kern, and the Zambezi River in Zambia allowed her to find herself—to trust her intuition and grow into her powers as a woman, overcoming multi-generational cycles of abuse and educational neglect.

In this propulsive story of finding meaning in a life outdoors, Bridget Crocker not only takes us along with her on exciting and sometimes treacherous adventures on the water but opens up a new way of experiencing the world—through its rivers, which can guide us, just as we can navigate them—and introduces a bold and vibrant new voice in adventure writing.",Hardcover,304 pages,"Expected publication June 3, 2025",Calificación no encontrada,No disponible,No disponible,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1730221274i/214389569.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/214389569-the-river-s-daughter,Memoir

—from the foreword by Jamie Lee Curtis

If you would have told a young John Stamos flipping burgers at his dad’s fast-food joint that one day he’d be a household name and that, at the height of his success, he’d be living alone, divorced, with no kids, high on a cocktail of forgetting, he might’ve asked, “You want fries with that?”

The highway she lives by regularly offers up gifts of roadkill, and in the dead of night Ava loves nothing more than to pull her latest discovery into her roadside den and record her findings.

False Claims: One Insider's Impossible Battle Against Big Pharma Corruption,Lisa Pratta,"For the first time, Lisa Pratta shares her story of going undercover as a whistleblower at a Big Pharma company and standing up to systemic corruption, greed, and harassment—all while caring for her special-needs son as a single mother.

When Lisa Pratta started her career as a pharmaceutical sales representative, she had no idea of the industry’s depravity, and the endemic sexual harassment, bribery, and fraud she witnessed only got worse over time.

Lisa hoped that might all change when she landed her dream job with a small company called Questcor which sold a drug that, when prescribed correctly, could help patients with multiple sclerosis. Yet Questcor realized they could make more money prescribing the drug .While the FDA had approved the drug for two- to three-week treatments, Questcor was training, encouraging, and incentivizing its sales force to push a five-day treatment plan not backed by any science—and arbitrarily increased the drug’s price to $28,000 for a single vial.

Pratta recognized this as being not only dangerous for patients, but also highly illegal. As the single mother of a special-needs son, Lisa couldn’t risk losing her job—but her moral compass also wouldn’t allow her to stay silent.

Thus began her double life as a whistleblower. For nearly a decade she clandestinely fed information to the Department of Justice. Resisting internal pressure to succumb to Questcor’s illegal sales tactics, she was constantly harassed by supervisors and in danger of being fired, while the government offered her no protection in the event her betrayal was discovered.

This incredible story offers an insider’s look at the unscrupulous sales methods used by America’s corrupt pharmaceutical industry, analyzes the levers they pull to extract ludicrous profits from the sick and dying, and is a page-turning portrait of one woman’s epic fight against Big Pharma and a mother’s heroic struggle to protect her family.",Hardcover,288 pages,"Expected publication June 3, 2025",Calificación no encontrada,No disponible,No disponible,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1729278219i/218431701.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/218431701-false-claims,Nonfiction

"Poet in the New World: Poems, 1946–1953",Czeslaw Milosz,"A new collection of work from Nobel laureate Czeslaw Milosz that includes previously untranslated poems written during his time in Washington, D.C., and his years in Europe before and after

One of the most revered poets of the twentieth century, Czeslaw Milosz famously bore witness to its violence in his native Poland and in the war’s aftermath from exile in Europe and the United States. Immediately after the war, he lived in Washington, D.C., working as a diplomatic official, having left behind an old world stained by bloodshed and still in the throes of ideological conflict as he sought to find his bearings in a new world.

Poet in the New World gathers the poems written during these years—for the first time in English translation—and is contextualized by the poetry that came directly before and after, from poems written in Warsaw in 1945, shortly before he departed for the United States, to others written in Europe from 1951 to 1953, after his significant time away. Capturing Milosz at his existential and stylistic best, Poet in the New World is attuned to the necessity of imagination and the duty of language and is filled with wonder and skepticism. Milosz grapples with the extraordinary violence he had witnessed in Warsaw and the strange postwar United States he has inhabited, all while pondering the enduring fate of his beloved Poland. In the poem “Warsaw,” the poet asks, “How can I live in this country/Where the foot knocks against/the unburied bones of kin?”

Equal parts affecting and illuminating, Poet in the New World is an essential addition to the Milosz canon, in a beautifully rendered translation by Robert Hass and David Frick, that reverberates with the questions of histories past, present, and future.",Hardcover,160 pages,"Expected publication February 4, 2025",Calificación no encontrada,No disponible,No disponible,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1719005512i/213111935.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213111935-poet-in-the-new-world,Poetry
Altered States of the Unflinching Souls,J.J. Campbell,"Promotional Collaboration. Limited Print.
New and selected poems by J.J. Campbell and Casey Renee Kiser with stunning cover artwork by Jasmyn Taylor Givens. Hitch a ride on this sick spectrum of realities and weave through the obstacle course of dull life contradictions with two bitch'n indie poets.

C. Renee's poetry is often a bewildered camp of bi-polaring over-share bares declaring their angst from waiting too long for a glacier or heart to melt, while auditioning for a g-spot in her wordplay. Often lyrical but always confessional, her work here rides the waves of triggered emotions, attempting to master the art of {girl overboard} and make any island her home. She prefers crashing when it comes to ships passing in the night, as she refuses to pass up a chance to face anything in her ocean head-on. Her killer backstroke keeps her alive and she washes ashore here, a crispy crab from the sun, sidestepping sharks but balancing out J.J.'s subtle hollowed-out style.

Campbell is all truth and bones rubbing together just enough to produce a campfire for one, except when hot legs invite themselves in for a little boom in the confession room where stripped down is an understatement. Always exposing the violent blur of day-to-day grind, he challenges daily horrors and the merry-go-round playback of dysfunction with swing-out spurts of lucid luck and fantasy. His poems reveal life's absurd complications with slaying simplicity and a humor that sneaks up on you, even quite skull-driving, like distant static from the basement television you left on for the chained-up ghost of your childhood fuckery. Somebody get that bitch a Baby Ruth. 

In this collection, two restless souls lose and laugh while it all goes up in flames, as the beautiful ones scramble to stay in the fakery-bakery on the corner of Suburbia. Relatable as a distant cousin-kiss in a dirty Sunday dress, you're encouraged to turn on a sad song with the happy hour light, buy a stranger a beer and confess something they'll never forget. Cheers to dark clouds, rainbows and all the misfits.

by J.J. Campbell:

the devil will see you now
you would have locked it
laughing at funerals
hopefully she bites
not a therapist
rampant in these streets
my own misery
cocaine whores and machine guns
at the oddest fucking moment
ashes
it never works out that way
at the top of their lungs
a warm hug
like lightning



by C. Renee Kiser:

kindred
i'll eat you
lost keys
rocks off at the lake of fire
three times charming the forest
twin flame / not trending
pretty something
hot-wired for cold rooms
i've lost my head and gained sight
under the table, you get scraps
god thing
loose lifetimes and tight timelines
alter egos aside
worst hitman i ever met
brunch with Linda
hunger-kind

The Ideological Brain: The Radical Science of Flexible Thinking,Leor Zmigrod,"Why do some people become radicalized?
How do ideologies shape the human brain?
And how can we unchain our minds from toxic dogmas?

In The Ideological Brain, Leor Zmigrod reveals the deep connection between political beliefs and the biology of the brain. Drawing on her own pioneering research, she uncovers the complex interplay between biology and environment that predisposes some individuals to rigid ways of thinking, and explains how ideologies take hold of our brains, fundamentally changing the way we think, act and interact with others. She shows how ideologues of all types struggle to change their thought patterns when faced with new information, culminating in the radical message that our politics are not superficial but are woven into the fabric of our minds.

This authoritative, accessible and playful blend of psychology, politics and philosophy explores the cutting-edge of the emerging field of political neuroscience. Zmigrod examines its historical roots before she looks to the future, considering the broader social and political implications of her groundbreaking research.

Above the Ether,Eric Barnes,"Here is a mesmerizing novel of unfolding dystopia amid the effects of climate change in a world very like our own, for readers of Emily St. John Mandel's Station Eleven and Margaret Atwood's The Year of the Flood.

In this prequel to Eric Barnes's acclaimed cli-fi novel The City Where We Once Lived, six sets of characters move through a landscape and a country just beginning to show the signs of cataclysmic change.

A father and his young children fleeing a tsunami after a massive earthquake in the Gulf. A woman and her husband punishing themselves without relent for the loss of both their sons to addiction, while wildfires slowly burn closer to their family home. A brilliant investor, assessing opportunity in the risk to crops, homes, cities, industries, and infrastructure, working in the silent comfort of her office sixty floors up in the scorching air. A doctor and his wife stuck in a refugee camp for immigrants somewhere in a southern desert. Two young men working the rides for a roadside carnival, one escaping a brutal past, the other a racist present. The manager of a chain of nondescript fast-food restaurants in a city ravaged by the relentless wind.

While every night the news alternates images of tsunami destruction with the baseball scores, the characters converge on a city where the forces of change have already broken—a city half abandoned, with one part left to be scavenged as the levee system protecting it slowly fails—until, in their vehicles on the highway that runs through it, they witness the approach of what looks to be just one more violent storm.",Hardcover,240 pages,"First published June 4, 2019",Calificación no encontrada,No disponible,No disponible,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1547942571i/43252696.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43252696-above-the-ether,Science Fiction

"Parent Yourself First: Raise Confident, Compassionate Kids by Becoming the Parent You Wish You'd Had",Bryana Kappadakunnel,"A fresh, no-nonsense parenting guide that shows you how to become a great parent (even if you didn’t have one yourself).

Many of us didn’t have a perfect childhood. But it’s never too late (or too early!) to transform into the parent you were always meant to be—grounded, present, intentional, compassionate, and confident. In Parent Yourself First, licensed marriage and family therapist Bryana Kappadakunnel argues that the secret to successful parenting is to UN-learn the wounded patterns you grew up with and create new ways to connect with your child. Parenting from a place of connection may feel unlike anything you experienced as a child or what you thought parenting was meant to be. But the results can be remarkable—and transformative.

As the founder of the popular Conscious Mommy community on Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok, Kappadakunnel explains that your upbringing is probably impacting your parenting style in ways you don’t even fully recognize, from how you manage your own emotions to how you connect with your kids in their vulnerable moments. In Parent Yourself First, she shares powerful stories from the families she’s counseled and practical tools for managing common parenting woes like tantrums and defiance. Her promise: You can break free of past patterns that no longer serve you and liberate your soul from old traumas and wounds.

Everyone has baggage. But it’s your responsibility to make sure your baggage doesn’t become your child’s problem. Healing yourself allows you to truly connect with your child; understand their needs; and guide them to live the happy, authentic life that they deserve.",Hardcover,336 pages,"Expected publication January 28, 2025",Calificación no encontrada,No disponible,No disponible,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1718979072i/212294465.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/212294465-parent-yourself-first,Self Help
