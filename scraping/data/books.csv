The Maverick's Museum: Albert Barnes and His American Dream,Blake Gopnik,"A fascinating biography of the philanthropist Albert Barnes, whose pioneering collection of modern art was meant to transform America’s soul

From prominent critic and biographer Blake Gopnik comes a compelling new portrait of America’s first great collector of modern art, Albert Coombs Barnes. Raised in a Philadelphia slum shortly after the Civil War, Barnes rose to earn a medical degree and then made a fortune from a pioneering antiseptic treatment for newborns. Never losing sight of the working-class neighbors of his youth, Barnes became a ruthless advocate for their rights and needs. His vast art collection—180 Renoirs, 67 Cézannes, 59 Matisses, 45 Picassos—was dedicated to enriching their cultural lives. A miner was more likely to get access than a mine owner.

Gopnik’s meticulous research reveals Barnes as a fierce advocate for the egalitarian ideals of his era’s progressive movement. But while his friends in the movement worked to reshape American society, Barnes wanted to transform the nation’s aesthetic life, taking art out of the hands of the elite and making it available to the average American.

The Maverick’s Museum offers a vivid picture of one of America’s great eccentrics. The sheer ferocity of Barnes’s democratic ambitions left him with more enemies than allies among people of all classes, but for a circle of intimates, he was a model of intelligence, generosity, and loyalty. In this compelling portrait, Gopnik reveals a life shaped by contradictions, one that left a lasting impact.",Hardcover,416 pages,"Expected publication March 18, 2025",0.00,0 ratings,1 review,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1731343701i/214504700.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/214504700-the-maverick-s-museum,Art

No One Is Self-Made: Build Your Village to Flourish in Business and Life,Lakeysha Hallmon,"This book isn’t just for one kind of entrepreneur—it’s for every kind. Whether you're thriving with purpose or struggling to grow your business and battle self-doubt, No One is Self-Made offers solutions and encouragement you need to push forward with the right community. From the visionary behind the groundbreaking Village Market, a direct pipeline connecting Black businesses to engaged consumers, this inspirational guide dares to dismantle the myth of individualism and reveals how collective support can shatter systemic barriers to success. It’s a bold roadmap for entrepreneurs and leaders determined to rewrite the rules of business.





Dr. Lakeysha Hallmon keeps this mantra pinned to her wall as a reminder of the undeniable impact of community. When she was pursuing her entrepreneurial dreams, she quickly saw the racial disparities and systemic issues affecting Black small businesses. She began meeting many brilliant entrepreneurs and small business owners, recognizing their potential to soar if backed by invested supporters.


In response, Dr. Hallmon founded the Village Market and challenged people to put the “Support is a Verb” mantra to action by rallying around businesses within their own communities. As a result, The Village Market funneled millions of dollars into local businesses, attacking the wealth gap and spiriting economic prosperity. This replicable model has inspired others nationwide to adopt a similar approach and economic strategy. She found that her beliefs were true: that by rooting our lives, businesses, and work in community–we find resources to create and support economic mobility from within.


is an inspirational narrative weaving together themes of community, purposeful businesses, and collective economics. This book debunks the myth of being self-made and empowers readers to abandon the notion and lean into community on their pathway to success. Entrepreneurs at any stage of growth will appreciate Dr. Hallmon’s story—with all the ups and downs of founding the Village Market—and the road-tested advice she dispenses for those trying to find success in business, career, and life. She explains economic and social factors, missteps that can derail goals, and the tools necessary to create their own thriving village. Along the way, it becomes clear why working within a collective is a more effective path to success than going it alone.",Hardcover,240 pages,"Expected publication February 4, 2025",0.00,0 ratings,0 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1726024586i/215087429.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/215087429-no-one-is-self-made,Business
"Don't Lead Alone: Think Like a System, Act Like a Network, Lead Like a Movement!",Cleveland Justis,"Think. Act. Lead.

It seems simple enough. But understanding your desired impact and how it fits into a larger picture, connecting your work to others and finding new collaborators, and bringing those collaborators together and moving them in a unified direction is never easy.

Governments, businesses, and nonprofits all have unique approaches and ideas that many of us learn through our work. Yet, we rarely consider the skills needed to create and maintain the partnerships between them. Most of us learn those skills through trial, error, and often, failure. Worse, we typically stay in our self-reinforcing silos, sharing perspectives and frustrations with like-minded people, limiting our vision of what our work can become. By partnering with other sectors, we combine and adapt approaches to solve complex problems, and leaders in any industry can create large-scale change.

Cleveland Justis and Daniel Student share a road map for effective partnerships that increase impact and profitability. Using real-life examples and practice exercises, the authors teach how to acquire and use skills to solve complex problems and propel your organization forward by combining a multitude of perspectives, split into three

Belly Full: Exploring Caribbean Cuisine through 11 Fundamental Ingredients and Over 100 Recipes,Lesley Enston,"A delectable exploration of Caribbean cuisine through 105 recipes based on eleven staple ingredients, featuring powerful insights into the shared history of the diaspora and gorgeous photography.

“Lesley’s recipes inspire in the ways they approach, transcend, and unify cultural boundaries on page after delicious page.”—Hawa Hassan, author of In Bibi’s Kitchen

Across the English-speaking Caribbean, “me belly full” can mean more than just a satisfied stomach, but a heart and soul that’s full too. In Belly Full, food writer of Trinidadian descent Lesley Enston brings us into the overlapping histories of the Caribbean islands through their rich cultures and cuisines.

Eleven staple ingredients—beans, calabaza, cassava, chayote, coconut, cornmeal, okra, plantains, rice, salted cod, and scotch bonnet peppers—hold echoes of familiarity from one island to the next, and their widespread use comes in part from the harrowing impact of the Atlantic Slave Trade and colonialism. As Lesley delves into how history shaped each country and territory’s cuisine, she shows us what we can learn from each island (such as Haiti, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Trinidad & Tobago, and Cuba) and encourages us to celebrate the delicious differences.

Belly Full provides basic knowledge on choosing, storing, and preparing these ingredients as well as a mix of traditional and creative adaptations to dishes. Recipes are mostly gluten-free and plant-based and include:

• Cornmeal: Pen Mayi from Haiti and Conkies from Barbados
• Okra: Callaloo from Trinidad and Tobago and Fungee from Antigua
• Plantains: Mofongo from Puerto Rico and Tortilla de Plátano Maduro from Cuba
• Salted Cod: Ackee and Saltfish from Jamaica and Accras de Morue from Martinique

Care and Feeding: A Memoir,Laurie Woolever,"In this moving, hilarious, and insightful memoir, Laurie Woolever traces her path from a small-town childhood to working at revered restaurants and food publications, alternately bolstered and overshadowed by two of the most powerful men in the business. But there’s more to the story than the two bold-faced names on her Mario Batali and Anthony Bourdain.

Behind the scenes, Laurie’s life is frequently chaotic, an often pleasurable buffet of bad decisions at which she frequently overstays her welcome. Acerbic and wryly self-deprecating, Laurie attempts to carve her own space as a woman in this world that is by turns toxic and intoxicating. Laurie seeks to try it all—from a seedy Atlantic City strip club to the Park Hyatt Tokyo, from a hippie vegetarian co-op to the legendary El Bulli—while balancing her consuming work with her sometimes ambivalent relationship to marriage and motherhood.

As the food world careens toward an overdue reckoning and Laurie’s mentors face their own high-profile descents, she is confronted with the questions of where she belongs and how to hold on to the parts of her life’s work that she truly values: care and feeding.",Hardcover,352 pages,"Expected publication March 11, 2025",4.75,4 ratings,2 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1721038990i/216497043.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216497043-care-and-feeding,Memoir

"The Disengaged Teen: Helping Kids Learn Better, Feel Better, and Live Better",Jenny Anderson,"A powerful toolkit for parents of both checked-out and stressed-out teens that shows exactly what to do (and stop doing) to support their academic and emotional flourishing.

Adolescents are hardwired to explore and grow, and learning is mainly how they do this. But a shocking majority of teens are disengaged from school, simultaneously bored and overwhelmed. This is feeding an alarming teen mental health crisis. As kids get older and more independent, parents often feel powerless to help. But fear not, there are evidence-backed strategies to guide them from disengagement to drive, in and out of school.

For the past five years, award-winning journalist Jenny Anderson and the Brookings Institution’s global education expert Rebecca Winthrop have been investigating why so many children lose their love of learning in adolescence. Now, weaving extensive original research with real-world stories of kids who transformed their relationships with learning, they identify four modes of learning that students use to navigate through the shifting academic demands and social dynamics of middle and high school, shaping the internal narratives about their skills, potential, and identity:

• Resister. When kids resist, they struggle silently with profound feelings of inadequacy or invisibility, which they communicate by ignoring homework, playing sick, skipping class, or acting out.

• Passenger. When kids coast along, consistently doing the bare minimum and complaining that classes are pointless. They need help connecting school to their skills, interests, or learning needs.

• Achiever. When kids show up, do the work, and get consistently high grades, their self-worth can become tied to high performance. Their disengagement is invisible, fueling a fear of failure and putting them at risk for mental health challenges.

• Explorer. When kids are driven by internal curiosity rather than just external expectations, they investigate the questions they care about and persist to achieve their goals.

Understanding your child’s learning modes is vital for nurturing their ability to become Explorers. Anderson and Winthrop outline simple yet counterintuitive parenting strategies for connecting with your child, tailoring your listening and communication styles to their needs, igniting their curiosity, and building self-awareness and emotional regulation.",Hardcover,352 pages,"Expected publication January 7, 2025",4.33,3 ratings,2 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1725748644i/211025367.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/211025367-the-disengaged-teen,Nonfiction
"Love, Queenie: Merle Oberon, Hollywood's First South Asian Star",Mayukh Sen,"A beautiful reclamation of a pioneering South Asian actress captures her glittering, complicated life and lasting impact on Hollywood.

Merle Oberon attained Hollywood immortality with a nomination for a Best Leading Actress Oscar for her role in the 1936 film The Dark Angel. It was the first time a performer of color had received an acting nomination at the Academy Awards, but because Oberon concealed her South Asian identity throughout her lifetime and “passed” for white, very few people knew it. In Love, Queenie, the first biography in more than forty years of the India-born actress, Mayukh Sen draws on family interviews and previously untapped archival research to animate the star’s hard-won journey to fame. From an upbringing in poverty, she rose to the highest echelons of the film-world elite during Hollywood’s racially exclusionary Golden Age.

Original Sins: The (Mis)education of Black and Native Children and the Construction of American Racism,Eve L. Ewing,"Why don’t our schools work? Eve L. Ewing tackles this question from a new angle: What if they’re actually doing what they were built to do? She argues that instead of being the great equalizer, America’s classrooms were designed to do the opposite: to maintain the nation’s inequalities. It’s a task at which they excel.

If all children could just get an education, the logic goes, they would have the same opportunities later in life. But this historical tour de force makes it clear that the opposite is true: The U.S. school system has played an instrumental role in creating and upholding racial hierarchies, preparing children to expect unequal treatment throughout their lives.

In , Ewing demonstrates that our schools were designed to propagate the idea of white intellectual superiority, to “civilize” Native students and to prepare Black students for menial labor. Education was not an afterthought for the Founding Fathers; it was envisioned by Thomas Jefferson as an institution that would fortify the country’s racial hierarchy. Ewing argues that these dynamics persist in a curriculum that continues to minimize the horrors of American history. The most insidious aspects of this system fall below the radar in the forms of standardized testing, academic tracking, disciplinary policies, and uneven access to resources.

By demonstrating that it’s in the DNA of American schools to serve as an effective and underacknowledged mechanism maintaining inequality in this country today, Ewing makes the case that we need a profound reevaluation of what schools are supposed to do, and for whom. This book will change the way people understand the place we send our children for eight hours a day.",Hardcover,400 pages,"Expected publication February 11, 2025",5.00,1 rating,0 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1729455599i/198563691.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/198563691-original-sins,Nonfiction

"Poet in the New World: Poems, 1946–1953",Czeslaw Milosz,"A new collection of work from Nobel laureate Czeslaw Milosz that includes previously untranslated poems written during his time in Washington, D.C., and his years in Europe before and after

One of the most revered poets of the twentieth century, Czeslaw Milosz famously bore witness to its violence in his native Poland and in the war’s aftermath from exile in Europe and the United States. Immediately after the war, he lived in Washington, D.C., working as a diplomatic official, having left behind an old world stained by bloodshed and still in the throes of ideological conflict as he sought to find his bearings in a new world.

Poet in the New World gathers the poems written during these years—for the first time in English translation—and is contextualized by the poetry that came directly before and after, from poems written in Warsaw in 1945, shortly before he departed for the United States, to others written in Europe from 1951 to 1953, after his significant time away. Capturing Milosz at his existential and stylistic best, Poet in the New World is attuned to the necessity of imagination and the duty of language and is filled with wonder and skepticism. Milosz grapples with the extraordinary violence he had witnessed in Warsaw and the strange postwar United States he has inhabited, all while pondering the enduring fate of his beloved Poland. In the poem “Warsaw,” the poet asks, “How can I live in this country/Where the foot knocks against/the unburied bones of kin?”

Equal parts affecting and illuminating, Poet in the New World is an essential addition to the Milosz canon, in a beautifully rendered translation by Robert Hass and David Frick, that reverberates with the questions of histories past, present, and future.",Hardcover,160 pages,"Expected publication February 4, 2025",4.50,2 ratings,1 review,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1719005512i/213111935.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213111935-poet-in-the-new-world,Poetry
Altered States of the Unflinching Souls,J.J. Campbell,"Promotional Collaboration. Limited Print.
New and selected poems by J.J. Campbell and Casey Renee Kiser with stunning cover artwork by Jasmyn Taylor Givens. Hitch a ride on this sick spectrum of realities and weave through the obstacle course of dull life contradictions with two bitch'n indie poets.

C. Renee's poetry is often a bewildered camp of bi-polaring over-share bares declaring their angst from waiting too long for a glacier or heart to melt, while auditioning for a g-spot in her wordplay. Often lyrical but always confessional, her work here rides the waves of triggered emotions, attempting to master the art of {girl overboard} and make any island her home. She prefers crashing when it comes to ships passing in the night, as she refuses to pass up a chance to face anything in her ocean head-on. Her killer backstroke keeps her alive and she washes ashore here, a crispy crab from the sun, sidestepping sharks but balancing out J.J.'s subtle hollowed-out style.

Campbell is all truth and bones rubbing together just enough to produce a campfire for one, except when hot legs invite themselves in for a little boom in the confession room where stripped down is an understatement. Always exposing the violent blur of day-to-day grind, he challenges daily horrors and the merry-go-round playback of dysfunction with swing-out spurts of lucid luck and fantasy. His poems reveal life's absurd complications with slaying simplicity and a humor that sneaks up on you, even quite skull-driving, like distant static from the basement television you left on for the chained-up ghost of your childhood fuckery. Somebody get that bitch a Baby Ruth. 

In this collection, two restless souls lose and laugh while it all goes up in flames, as the beautiful ones scramble to stay in the fakery-bakery on the corner of Suburbia. Relatable as a distant cousin-kiss in a dirty Sunday dress, you're encouraged to turn on a sad song with the happy hour light, buy a stranger a beer and confess something they'll never forget. Cheers to dark clouds, rainbows and all the misfits.

by J.J. Campbell:

the devil will see you now
you would have locked it
laughing at funerals
hopefully she bites
not a therapist
rampant in these streets
my own misery
cocaine whores and machine guns
at the oddest fucking moment
ashes
it never works out that way
at the top of their lungs
a warm hug
like lightning



by C. Renee Kiser:

kindred
i'll eat you
lost keys
rocks off at the lake of fire
three times charming the forest
twin flame / not trending
pretty something
hot-wired for cold rooms
i've lost my head and gained sight
under the table, you get scraps
god thing
loose lifetimes and tight timelines
alter egos aside
worst hitman i ever met
brunch with Linda
hunger-kind

The Ideological Brain: The Radical Science of Flexible Thinking,Leor Zmigrod,"Why do some people become radicalized?
How do ideologies shape the human brain?
And how can we unchain our minds from toxic dogmas?

In The Ideological Brain, Leor Zmigrod reveals the deep connection between political beliefs and the biology of the brain. Drawing on her own pioneering research, she uncovers the complex interplay between biology and environment that predisposes some individuals to rigid ways of thinking, and explains how ideologies take hold of our brains, fundamentally changing the way we think, act and interact with others. She shows how ideologues of all types struggle to change their thought patterns when faced with new information, culminating in the radical message that our politics are not superficial but are woven into the fabric of our minds.

"The Disengaged Teen: Helping Kids Learn Better, Feel Better, and Live Better",Jenny Anderson,"A powerful toolkit for parents of both checked-out and stressed-out teens that shows exactly what to do (and stop doing) to support their academic and emotional flourishing.

Adolescents are hardwired to explore and grow, and learning is mainly how they do this. But a shocking majority of teens are disengaged from school, simultaneously bored and overwhelmed. This is feeding an alarming teen mental health crisis. As kids get older and more independent, parents often feel powerless to help. But fear not, there are evidence-backed strategies to guide them from disengagement to drive, in and out of school.

For the past five years, award-winning journalist Jenny Anderson and the Brookings Institution’s global education expert Rebecca Winthrop have been investigating why so many children lose their love of learning in adolescence. Now, weaving extensive original research with real-world stories of kids who transformed their relationships with learning, they identify four modes of learning that students use to navigate through the shifting academic demands and social dynamics of middle and high school, shaping the internal narratives about their skills, potential, and identity:

• Resister. When kids resist, they struggle silently with profound feelings of inadequacy or invisibility, which they communicate by ignoring homework, playing sick, skipping class, or acting out.

• Passenger. When kids coast along, consistently doing the bare minimum and complaining that classes are pointless. They need help connecting school to their skills, interests, or learning needs.

• Achiever. When kids show up, do the work, and get consistently high grades, their self-worth can become tied to high performance. Their disengagement is invisible, fueling a fear of failure and putting them at risk for mental health challenges.

• Explorer. When kids are driven by internal curiosity rather than just external expectations, they investigate the questions they care about and persist to achieve their goals.

Understanding your child’s learning modes is vital for nurturing their ability to become Explorers. Anderson and Winthrop outline simple yet counterintuitive parenting strategies for connecting with your child, tailoring your listening and communication styles to their needs, igniting their curiosity, and building self-awareness and emotional regulation.",Hardcover,352 pages,"Expected publication January 7, 2025",4.33,3 ratings,2 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1725748644i/211025367.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/211025367-the-disengaged-teen,Self Help
The Pretty Victory: 100-Day Guide to Recenter Yourself and Find Your Purpose,Pretty Vee,"From “rising superstar” (BET), comedic actress, and online personality Pretty Vee comes a 100-day devotional and guided journal to help you define your goals, find the strength to reach them, and unapologetically go out and get what you’ve been dreaming of.

Pretty Vee, a multi-talented comedian, actress, and philanthropist, has crafted a captivating and unique devotional blending humor, sincerity, and relatability to help make the path to spiritual enlightenment accessible and engaging for everyone. She lives by the mantra “a delay is not a denial,” meaning we all have hopes and dreams, but we may need a little help to get past the hurdles. She herself has faced the anxiety of not knowing how to move forward in her life, before her pastor mother helped her recenter and find her purpose. Far too often, life pushes us to move from one task to the next, creating a perpetual cycle of doing, doing, doing without ever taking a moment to simply sit and relish our blessings. We get so caught up in the hustle that we forget to look around and be grateful for what we already have, and what we’ve already accomplished.

This 100-day devotional is meant to be a guided journal to help you reach your goals and find a deeper connection with God while prioritizing your mental and emotional health. Pretty Vee includes prompts to help you reflect on your journey towards gratitude, stillness, and speaking your truth. Her many friends and mentors, including Shaquille O’Neal, Nick Cannon, Lil Duval, Missy Elliott, Tiffany Haddish, Dwyane Wade, and Charlamagne Tha God also add their visions for a Pretty Victory.

While Pretty Vee has one foot firmly in entertaining, she also sees part of her path as helping to give back. With she shows that brokenness doesn’t last forever. And that miracles, hope, and ultimately victories are all there for you too.",Hardcover,256 pages,"Expected publication February 11, 2025",3.00,2 ratings,2 reviews,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1728999068i/212806662.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/212806662-the-pretty-victory,Self Help
